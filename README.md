    To add ingredients to your list, type "remove".
    To get recipes from your ingredients, type "recipes"
    To shut down the program, type "bye"

How does it work?

    Mainly depends on Spoonacular API.
    Uses status mechanism for making sure inputs are valid for making a request.

What could be better?

    There could be a GUI integrated.
    Spoonacular API offers loads of features, such as provided image for the recipe, max carbs, gluten - free or vegan recipes etc.
    Could be in estonian.
    Requests to Spoonacular API are limited - 3 to 4 requests per one use are coded right now. If used heavily, requests get used up (150 per day limit).

Learning curves:

    Integrating API to code.
    Using status mechanism.
    Converting data to json file, reading from json file.
    A slight introduction to GUIs.
